## 👋 About Me

I am a passionate **Computer Science student** with a strong interest in **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**.
I completed a **6-week ML internship**, where I built real-world AI projects such as:

* Fake News Detection System (92% accuracy)
* Spam Message Classifier
* Multiple ML experiments using Python, scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook

I actively learn from platforms like YouTube, Google, and ChatGPT, and I enjoy solving problems using clean, data-driven approaches. I’m eager to work on impactful AI projects and improve my skills every day.
